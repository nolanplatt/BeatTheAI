<h1>BeatTheAi.io - About</h1>


<p>BeatTheAi.io is a cross-platform, cross-device, cross-browser 5G qualified "guess and draw the word" game, similar to scribbl.io. An AI built in Python uses image recognition to find what an image is in seconds. A frontend, built in JavaScript, utilizes an API built on a Python flask server that tunnels through a Google Cloud based MongoDB database. Built in less than ten hours, this project shows the power of AI and imagine recognition. </p>
